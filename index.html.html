								<p> Dear All

									I wish everyone a happy new year. May 2022 be a year of bountiful achievements in both our personal and official lives.
									
									2021 was an interesting year, as we grappled with the effects of the pandemic, and adjusted to a new way of life for ourselves and our customers.
									
									We can look back though and see the many things we were able to achieve. We expanded our fibre footprint and strengthened our customer base with our customers voting us as a preferred connectivity provider. We received several awards for our creativity and innovation. Efficiency and judicious application of scarce resources remains a watchword within the group. This has enabled us to not only be consistent in meeting salary obligations to employees, but also boldly implement a salary increase during a challenging economic period in the country.
									
									In 2022, we aim to consolidate on these achievements and cement further our premier position in the industry.
									
									We were also able to start several initiatives to improve our work effectiveness and operational efficiency, from the PEM framework to our deterministic approach to budgeting, and our focus on KPIs and monthly performance reporting amongst others.
									
									It becomes imperative in 2022 that we perfect our execution of these initiatives especially our drive for operational efficiency as they would provide the fulcrum to further our ambition to become one of the most outstanding world class organizations in Africa.
									
									We will explore and exploit other business opportunities that are being created by the services that we provide. These opportunities have the potential to accelerate our growth as an organization. However, in order to harness them successfully, we recognize that we need to invest in developing the managerial skills of our employees so they can manage the demands that this growth is sure to bring. We therefore encourage everyone to embrace and take ownership for self-development to enable them take higher responsibility in the expanded organization. We will continue to invest in developing people to help them fulfil these responsibilities.
									
									To enable employees benefit from the value created for the company, we will be introducing the ipNX employee share options scheme in addition to the existing profit share scheme. However, in order to do this, we have to be committed to and perfect our performance management system as it forms the basis for fair allocation of Rewards.
									
									In spite of the challenging economic conditions, Nigeria still presents a promising business environment and we will remain bullish about what we can achieve.
									
									I wish us all an amazing new year in good health and peace of mind as we collectively work to achieve our 2022 goals and objectives.
									
									<br>best regards
									
									<br>Ejovi Aror
									
									
									</p>
